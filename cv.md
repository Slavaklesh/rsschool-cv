## About me:
### I work as an energy engineer at the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus. After working in this position for several years, I realized that I was starting to stagnate in terms of development. so I decided to try myself in (RS school). Previously had experience in software testing. I hope my knowledge, diligence and courses will help me gain useful knowledge.
